# adjacency-list-dijkstras

A shortest pathing implementation using Dijkstra's algorithm and adjacency lists.  Adjacency values are provided in the form of (node_id, node_id, path_weight). For example, the value between node 3 and 5 with a weight of 7 would be represented by (3, 5, 7).  End of input is indicated by (0, 0, 0).
